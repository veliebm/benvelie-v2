I've had cats for 25 years. I've been scooping their litterboxes for most of that time. Consequently, sometimes I wonder whether I have [Toxoplasmosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis), a parasite that can infect humans who interact with infected cat poop. Surely, after all these years, I have it, right?

Probably not. And, assuming you live in the U.S., you probably don't either, even if you're a huge cat lover like me.

Let's start with base rates. Globally, the lifetime Toxoplasmosis infection rate for a human is [about 1 in 3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12879-025-11265-y), and in the U.S. is [about 1 in 8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4047742#:~:text=The%20overall%20T%2E%20gondii%20antibody%20seroprevalence%20among%20persons%20%E2%89%A5%206%20years%20of%20age%20in%202009%E2%80%932010%20was%2013%2E2%25%20%2895%25%20confidence%20limit%20%5BCL%5D%2011%2E8%25%2C%2014%2E5%25%29). Among cat owners, who we'd expect to be more at risk, the prevalence rates are [about the same](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299502248_Relationship_Between_Cat_Contact_and_Infection_by_Toxoplasma_gondii_in_Humans_A_Meta-Analysis) as non-cat owners.

How can that be? Don't cats give us Toxoplasmosis? You'd think that we, cat owners, are around kitties all the time and thus we should get it more. And how do non-cat owners get it? They aren't scooping any cat poop regularly.

Toxoplasmosis isn't [only transmitted by cat poop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis#:~:text=Oral,seafood). It's also transmitted from eating meat that hasn't been cooked enough, eating unwashed fruits and vegetables from contaminated soil, or gardening and not washing your hands.[^1] Everyone is MOSTLY getting infections from that stuff and RARELY from their pet cats - not the other way around.

Even if you're around cats a lot (and scooping their poop), assuming you live in the U.S. and are therefore subject to the pretty low base rate here, you probably don't have Toxoplasmosis (and neither do I).

Why don't more of us have it?

There are a few factors that help to explain that.

Factor 1: Cat poop isn't infectious right away. It takes [1 to 5 days](https://capcvet.org/guidelines/toxoplasma-gondii/) after leaving the cat for the eggs (technically called oocysts) to activate and become infectious. Many people scoop their litter boxes every day, which means they're cleaning them before the eggs are infectious.

Factor 2: Most cats only shed the parasite's eggs [once](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/toxoplasmosis/toxoplasmosis-in-animals), shortly after they're infected, and then never again. Rarely, cats shed again, especially when [re-infected with a new strain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29279081/), but most don't. When cats shed the eggs, it tends to be for [only 1 to 3 weeks](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/toxoplasmosis/index.html). So, for most cats, assuming they get infected with the parasite, there's a VERY short window of opportunity for a human to become infected from that cat.

Factor 3: Many pet cats are indoors only. Cats get the parasite from eating infected meat, which usually happens from them going outside and hunting.[^2] If your cat is strictly indoors and eating commercial ([and not raw](https://www.petmd.com/cat/nutrition/can-cats-have-raw-food-diet)) cat food, the chance of them getting infected is near zero.

Factor 4: Most cats don't get Toxoplasmosis to begin with. The European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases states that [around only one third of cats](https://www.abcdcatsvets.org/guideline-for-toxoplasma-gondii-infection) get it at some point during their lives.

So, to summarize: For you to get Toxoplasmosis from your cat (A) they have to get it at all, and most cats don't, (B) your cat has to eat uncooked, infected meat, (C) you have to get it during the short window when your cat is shedding the parasite's eggs, and (D) the poop has to sit in the litter box for at least 24 hours before you scoop it.[^3]

What about the other vectors that can infect humans with Toxoplasmosis?

Like I mentioned earlier, raw meat is a big one. So cook your meats. Wearing gloves while gardening and [washing your hands after](https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/prevention/index.html) is a good idea, since cats can poop in your garden, and the parasite's eggs can live for months there. Also, wash fruits and veggies before eating them, because if any infected cats have pooped in the soil that the produce is growing in, you can get infected from eating them. [Toxoplasmosis has been found on fruits and vegetables before](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13071-020-04040-2), and [the CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html) washing or cooking produce before consumption to reduce your risk of getting the parasite.

Finally, I know this is tangential to my main argument, but what actually happens if you get Toxoplasmosis?

[For most people](https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/symptoms/index.html), you get no symptoms at all.[^4] People who do get sick from the infection usually get mild flu-like symptoms that eventually go away. However, people with compromised immune systems (e.g., from HIV or cancer) can get nasty, dangerous complications like brain inflammation. And, unfortunately, the fetuses of people who get infected for the first time during pregnancy or just before getting pregnant can have a variety of [sad and serious bad health effects](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9756-toxoplasmosis).

So, to summarize (more): Most Americans don't have Toxoplasmosis. Most cats don't. When Americans get it, they usually don't get it from their own cats - they usually get it from eating infected meat or accidentally ingesting the parasites' eggs from soil or unwashed produce. If you do get it, you probably won't notice, or you might get something like the flu. Unless you're pregnant or are about to be pregnant, in which case your child could be hurt really badly.

Take home message? If you're not immunocompromised or pregnant or trying to become pregnant, then go forth and clean thy litter box![^5] You probably won't get Toxoplasmosis from doing that (even after years of scooping), and even if you do, it's not the end of the world.

[^1]: OK, getting an infection from gardening or from contaminated produce is *technically* still getting an infection from cat poop. (Cats poop in gardens. And what do you think the produce was contaminated *with*?) However, the point remains that infections from those aren't the fault of our own kitties (or their litter boxes).

[^2]: Unless an infected mouse is unlucky enough to stumble into the home of you and your adorable little killer.

[^3]: I'll be honest though, I'm pretty lazy about scooping daily myself.

[^4]: But the parasite still lives in your body from then on anyway. Presumably, if your cat then eats you, your cat will get Toxoplasmosis. Or if your friends eat you without cooking you first, they'll get it. How droll.

[^5]: But still wash your hands after, because ew.
